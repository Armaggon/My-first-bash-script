# My-first-bash-script
This is one of my first Bash Scripts ever coded, I was only 14 years old, and I recently just updated some functionality. If you find spelling errors then my 14 year old self sincerely apologises. (Not completely functional :) )
I only put it up here so I can occasionally come back and laugh at how bad I was xd
